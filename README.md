# Zellaude

A Zellij status bar plugin that replaces the default tab bar with Claude Code and Codex activity awareness.

![Zellaude status bar example](assets/bar-example.svg)

## Features

- **Full tab bar** — shows all Zellij tabs (not just agent sessions), replacing the native tab bar
- **Session & mode display** — shows the Zellij session name and current input mode (NORMAL, LOCKED, PANE, etc.) with color-coded indicators
- **Live activity indicators** — see what every Claude Code and Codex session is doing at a glance; non-agent tabs remain visible without activity glyphs
- **Attach-time recovery** — recognizes agent sessions and effort modes that were already running when the status bar attached
- **Theme-aware palette** — follows Zellij's live theme colors; Gruvbox Dark is explicitly verified
- **Ultra-mode rainbow** — tab names shimmer through rainbow colors for Codex `ultra` sessions and Claude Code `ultracode` sessions
- **Split Three** — upgraded Pane-mode versions of Split Right and Split Down create three equal panes at once
- **Custom states** — open a named command grid in a new tab with `Ctrl+t`, `Shift+n`
- **Session templates** — describe a multi-tab session once and start it with `zellij -s work -n <name>`
- **Clickable tabs** — click any tab to switch to it
- **Smart pane focus** — clicking an agent-aware tab focuses its most recently active Claude Code or Codex pane, revealing it inside a stack; waiting (⚠) sessions retain priority
- **Permission flash** — sessions pulse with the theme's error color for 2 seconds when a permission request arrives
- **Desktop notifications** — macOS notification on permission requests (rate-limited to once per 10s per tab), with click-to-focus support via [terminal-notifier](https://github.com/julienXX/terminal-notifier)
- **Elapsed time** — shows how long a session has been in its current state (after 30s), making it easy to spot stuck sessions
- **Multi-instance sync** — all Zellij tabs show a unified view of all sessions

### Activity symbols

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| ◆ | Session starting |
| ● | Thinking |
| ⚡ | Running Bash |
| ◉ | Reading / searching files |
| ✎ | Editing / writing files |
| ⊜ | Spawning subagent |
| ◈ | Web search / fetch |
| ⚙ | Other tool |
| ▶ | Waiting for user prompt |
| ⚠ | Waiting for permission |
| ✓ | Done |
| ○ | Idle |

Indicator colors come from the active Zellij theme. Ultra-mode tab names remain an intentional animated RGB exception.

### Pane mode bindings

Open Pane mode with `Ctrl+p`, then use:

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Shift+r` | **Split Three Right** — split the current pane into three equal-width columns |
| `Shift+d` | **Split Three Down** — split the current pane into three equal-height rows |

Both commands focus the newest pane and return to Normal mode, matching Zellij's built-in Split Right (`r`) and Split Down (`d`) flow. When the available cells are not divisible by three, pane sizes differ by at most one cell. Zellaude installs the uppercase bindings for the running client without writing to `config.kdl`. If either key already has a custom Pane-mode binding, Zellaude leaves it untouched. Approve Zellij's **Change runtime configuration** and **Execute actions as the user** permissions when prompted so the session-only bindings and exact resize sequence can run.

### Custom states

Add one or more named states to `~/.config/zellij/plugins/zellaude.json`:

```json
{
  "custom_states": [
    {
      "id": "claude6",
      "width": 3,
      "height": 2,
      "commands": [
        "claude -n A1 \"/implementing-agent I'm A1\"",
        "claude -n A2 \"/implementing-agent I'm A2\"",
        "claude -n A3 \"/implementing-agent I'm A3\"",
        "claude -n A4 \"/implementing-agent I'm A4\"",
        "claude -n A5 \"/implementing-agent I'm A5\"",
        "claude -n A6 \"/implementing-agent I'm A6\""
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Reload the plugin (or restart the Zellij session) after editing the file. Then press `Ctrl+t`, `Shift+n`, type the state ID, and press `Enter`. Zellaude opens a new tab with the configured grid, mapping the command array to panes from left to right, top to bottom. Press `Esc` or `Ctrl+c` to cancel the prompt.

The new tab repeats the bars of the tab it was opened from — Zellaude above the grid, Zellij's status bar below it. Zellij parses a plugin-created layout on its own, so a generated tab never inherits `default_tab_template`; anything the layout leaves out is simply missing from that tab.

`width` and `height` may be JSON numbers or numeric strings. A state needs at least one command, the command count may not exceed `width × height`, and a state may contain at most 64 panes; the resulting grid must also fit the current terminal. When there are fewer commands than cells, the unused bottom-right cells open as normal shell panes.

For counts that don't fill a rectangle, `commands` may instead be an array of arrays. Each inner array is one row, and the row shapes are the layout — rows may hold different pane counts, each row splits its full width equally among its panes, and no filler cells appear:

```json
{
  "custom_states": [
    {
      "id": "claude5",
      "commands": [
        ["claude -n A1", "claude -n A2"],
        ["claude -n A3", "claude -n A4", "claude -n A5"]
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

A nested state takes no `width` or `height` (setting either is an error), every row needs at least one command, and the 64-pane cap still applies. Commands run through `sh -lc` in the directory of the pane where the prompt was opened when Zellij can resolve it, falling back to Zellij's default working directory otherwise. Custom-state configuration should therefore be treated as trusted local shell code.

The settings file may also contain a single state object or an array of states, although the `custom_states` wrapper is recommended because it coexists with Zellaude's UI settings. As an alternative, states can be supplied directly in the plugin block; this takes precedence over the settings file:

```kdl
plugin location="file:~/.config/zellij/plugins/zellaude.wasm" {
    custom_states r#"[{"id":"shells","width":2,"height":1,"commands":["htop","git status"]}]"#
}
```

Zellaude installs `Shift+n` in Tab mode for the running client without changing `config.kdl`. If that key already has a user binding, the user binding wins and the custom-state shortcut remains unavailable.

### Session templates

A session template describes a whole session — its tabs, their commands and
their directories — and Zellaude compiles it into a layout Zellij starts
natively:

```bash
zellij -s work -n zellaude
```

`zellaude` is the built-in template, available without any configuration:

| Tab | Panes |
|-----|-------|
| `git` | `lazygit` beside `btop` |
| `claude` | `claude` |
| `editor` | `nvim` |
| `shell` | plain shell |

Define your own in `~/.config/zellij/plugins/zellaude.json`:

```json
{
  "session_templates": [
    {
      "name": "work",
      "tabs": [
        { "name": "git", "commands": ["lazygit", "btop"] },
        { "name": "claude", "commands": ["claude"] },
        { "name": "editor", "cwd": "src", "commands": ["nvim"] },
        { "name": "shell" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Reload the plugin after editing, then `zellij -s work -n work`. A template named
`zellaude` replaces the built-in.

A tab's `commands` become one pane each, arranged in a single row by default;
`width` and `height` lay them out as a grid, reading order left-to-right and
top-to-bottom. A tab may contain at most 64 panes, and its command count may
not exceed `width × height`; when there are fewer commands than cells, the
spare cells open as plain shell panes at the reading-order tail. Setting
`width` or `height` without `commands` is a config error. A tab without
`commands` is a plain shell tab, and a template needs at least one tab.
`focus` starts the session on that tab — at most one tab may set it, and
setting it on more than one is a config error. Commands run through `sh -lc`,
so template configuration is trusted local shell code, exactly as for custom
states.

Omitting `cwd` opens panes in the directory `zellij` was run from, which is
usually what you want. A relative `cwd` resolves against that same directory,
so `"src"` means `<where you ran zellij>/src`; absolute paths are used as
given, and `~` is expanded at compile time. A tab's `cwd` overrides the
template's.

Templates are compiled to `~/.config/zellij/layouts/<name>.kdl`, so template
names are held to filesystem- and flag-safe rules: 1 to 64 characters, only
letters, digits, `.`, `_` and `-`, never `.` or `..`, and never starting with
`-`. Every generated file begins with a `// zellaude-generated` marker, and
Zellaude only ever writes or removes files carrying it — a layout you wrote
yourself is never overwritten, even if a template shares its name. Problems
are reported to Zellij's own log rather than the bar — by default
`/tmp/zellij-<uid>/zellij-log/zellij.log`, written on every run regardless of
`--debug`; that flag only raises its verbosity.

### Launch environment

Agents are often started with their environment set on the command line —
`ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=… ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN=… claude`. Zellaude records the
variables that decide where a session points, for both Claude Code and Codex,
so a tool that relaunches the pane can start it the same way instead of
reaching the default endpoint.

Which list a name sits in decides what happens to its value:

| List | Recorded as | Built-in names |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| `verbatim` | the value itself | `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`, `ANTHROPIC_MODEL`, `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK`, `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_VERTEX`, `CLAUDE_CODE_EFFORT_LEVEL`, `ZELLAUDE_CLAUDE_MODE`, `CODEX_HOME`, `CODEX_SQLITE_HOME`, `OPENAI_BASE_URL` |
| `secret` | `<set>` — never the value | `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `CODEX_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY` |

One exception: a secret whose value is exactly `local` is recorded as `local`,
so a session pointed at a local proxy replays without you re-supplying
anything.

Add your own names in `~/.config/zellij/plugins/zellaude.json`:

```json
{
  "launch_env_names": {
    "verbatim": ["ANTHROPIC_CUSTOM_HEADERS"],
    "secret": ["MY_GATEWAY_TOKEN"]
  }
}
```

Both lists are optional. Names match exactly — no prefixes — so nothing is
recorded that you did not name. **A name you add to `verbatim` is written to
disk with its value**, so put anything credential-shaped under `secret`; a name
in both lists is treated as a secret.

The file can only add names. It cannot move a built-in name to the other list,
and it cannot extend the `local` exception — both are fixed in code, so no
settings file, mistaken or hostile, can turn a built-in secret into a recorded
value. A missing, unreadable or malformed file leaves the built-in lists
unchanged.

Removing a name you added stops it being recorded, and drops it from the pane's
cached entry on the next event.

### Settings

Click the **Zellaude** prefix on the left side of the bar to open the settings menu. Click it again (or the `×` button) to close. Settings are persisted to `~/.config/zellij/plugins/zellaude.json`.

| Setting | Options | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|---------|-------------|
| Notifications | Always / Unfocused / Off | Always | Desktop notifications on permission requests. "Unfocused" only notifies when the requesting pane is on a different tab. |
| Flash | Persist / Brief / Off | Brief | Theme-colored flash on permission requests. "Persist" keeps flashing until resolved, "Brief" flashes for 2 seconds. |
| Elapsed time | On / Off | On | Show time since last activity (appears after 30s). |
| Smart focus | On / Off | On | Clicking an agent-aware tab focuses its most recently active agent pane (waiting ⚠ sessions first). Off makes tab clicks plain tab switches. |

## Install

### Prerequisites

- [Zellij 0.44 or newer](https://zellij.dev)
- [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) — required by the hook bridge, by settings persistence, and by the install scripts

### Quick install

Add the plugin to your Zellij layout — that's it:

```kdl
default_tab_template {
    pane size=1 borderless=true {
        plugin location="https://github.com/joeyjeong07/zellaude/releases/latest/download/zellaude.wasm"
    }
    children
}
```

Once you grant its permissions (see below), the plugin installs the hook script and registers it with Claude Code and Codex on its own. No cloning, no install scripts.

[Codex requires a one-time review](https://developers.openai.com/codex/hooks) before running newly installed user hooks. Start Codex, open `/hooks`, inspect the Zellaude handlers, and trust them.

### Granting permissions

Zellaude needs seven Zellij permissions, and everything it does is gated behind
them — the hook install, the runtime keybindings, and the bar itself. Until they
are granted the bar renders empty.

Zellij asks by drawing its prompt *inside the plugin's pane*. As a one-row
borderless status bar there is nothing to draw into, and normal focus navigation
skips the pane, so the prompt cannot be answered where it appears. Grant them
once in a full-size pane instead. Zellij keys the grant to the plugin location,
so use the command matching how you installed it.

For the remote plugin in [Quick install](#quick-install):

```bash
zellij action new-pane --plugin https://github.com/joeyjeong07/zellaude/releases/latest/download/zellaude.wasm
```

For a plugin built and installed locally:

```bash
zellij action new-pane --plugin "file:$HOME/.config/zellij/plugins/zellaude.wasm"
```

Press `y` in that pane, then close it (`Ctrl+p`, `x`). The grant is cached, so
every bar instance — including new tabs and later sessions — picks it up. If the
bar is already on screen and blank, clicking it also re-raises the prompt.

The seven are `ReadApplicationState`, `ChangeApplicationState`, `RunCommands`,
`ReadCliPipes`, `MessageAndLaunchOtherPlugins`, `Reconfigure` and
`RunActionsAsUser`. `RunCommands` is what lets the plugin shell out to install
the hook script and read its settings file; `Reconfigure` and `RunActionsAsUser`
back the session-only keybindings described above. The grant is recorded in
Zellij's own cache — `zellij setup --check` prints the directory, typically
`~/.cache/zellij/permissions.kdl`.

Installing from source does this for you; see below.

### Build from source

Prerequisites: [Rust](https://rustup.rs) (in addition to the above)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/joeyjeong07/zellaude.git
cd zellaude
./install.sh
```

The script first checks for `jq`, `cargo`, `rustup`, and Zellij 0.44 or newer
before writing anything. It adds `~/.cargo/bin` to its `PATH` when needed and
installs the `wasm32-wasip1` target if it is not already present. It then runs a
locked release build with an explicit target and target directory, verifies the
resulting WASM is nonempty, and atomically installs it to
`~/.config/zellij/plugins/`. Finally, it pre-grants the permissions above so the
first run is not an empty bar and registers the hooks. You can invoke the script
from any directory; all project paths are resolved relative to `install.sh`.

Set `ZELLAUDE_INSTALL_HOME` when staging an installation for a different home
or running an isolated test. The helpers use that directory for the plugin,
Claude/Codex settings, and Zellij cache instead of inheriting the invoking
account's `CODEX_HOME` or `XDG_CACHE_HOME`. Hook registrations intentionally
remain portable as `${HOME}/.config/zellij/plugins/zellaude-hook.sh`, so the
staged directory must be that user's `HOME` when the clients later run. Set
`ZELLAUDE_BUILD_DIR` to choose the Cargo target directory; relative values are
resolved from the project directory. Run `./install.sh --help` for the complete
option summary.

Pass `--no-permissions` to skip the pre-grant and approve interactively instead:

```bash
./install.sh --no-permissions
```

That leaves `permissions.kdl` untouched, so the bar stays inert until you grant
the seven by hand in a full-size pane — see [Granting permissions](#granting-permissions).
Everything else the script does is unchanged.

#### What it touches

| Path | Change |
|------|--------|
| `~/.config/zellij/plugins/zellaude.wasm` | created |
| `~/.config/zellij/plugins/zellaude-hook.sh` | created, version-tagged, `+x` |
| `~/.cache/zellij/permissions.kdl` | zellaude's block replaced; other plugins' grants preserved |
| `~/.claude/settings.json` | zellaude hook entries replaced under 11 events; previous file copied to `.bak` |
| `${CODEX_HOME:-~/.codex}/hooks.json` | same under 9 events; previous file copied to `.bak` |

Both JSON files are created as `{}` if absent, symlinks are resolved before
writing so `mv` cannot replace them with regular files, and the jq filters only
replace the exact hook commands Zellaude owns. Re-running the script is
idempotent, while unrelated hooks—even commands that mention
`zellaude-hook.sh`—are left alone. Your Zellij layout is never modified; that
step is below.

### Wiring it into a layout

The plugin replaces the native tab bar, so it goes where `zellij:tab-bar` would.
For a fresh setup, add it to your layout:

```kdl
default_tab_template {
    pane size=1 borderless=true {
        plugin location="file:~/.config/zellij/plugins/zellaude.wasm"
    }
    children
}
```

If you already have a layout in `layout_dir`, swap the location string in every
template that draws a tab bar — a stock `default.kdl` has **two**,
`default_tab_template` and `new_tab_template`, and missing the second leaves new
tabs on the native bar:

```diff
 default_tab_template {
     pane size=1 borderless=true {
-        plugin location="zellij:tab-bar"
+        plugin location="file:~/.config/zellij/plugins/zellaude.wasm"
     }
     children
     pane size=2 borderless=true {
         plugin location="zellij:status-bar"
     }
 }
```

Leave the `zellij:status-bar` pane alone — Zellaude replaces the *tab* bar only.
Keep `size=1 borderless=true`: the bar renders one row, and a bordered pane
clips it.

Layouts are read at session start, so restart Zellij (or start a new session)
to pick the change up; running sessions keep the bar they launched with.

Or try the included layout directly, without touching your own:

```bash
zellij --layout layout.kdl
```

### Optional: desktop notifications

The bar itself needs nothing extra. Desktop notifications on permission requests
are delegated to whatever notifier the platform has, so they are silently
skipped when none is installed.

**macOS** — notifications work out of the box via `osascript`. For ones that
focus the requesting pane when clicked, install
[terminal-notifier](https://github.com/julienXX/terminal-notifier):

```bash
brew install terminal-notifier
```

Without it notifications still appear, but clicking them won't focus the pane.

**Linux** — install `notify-send`, or nothing is delivered at all:

```bash
sudo apt install libnotify-bin   # or: dnf install libnotify / pacman -S libnotify
```

There is no click-to-focus on Linux; `terminal-notifier` is macOS-only.

The **Unfocused** notification setting also needs a way to ask which window is
frontmost. macOS uses `osascript`. X11 needs [`xdotool`](https://github.com/jordansissel/xdotool);
without it — and on Wayland, which exposes no standard way to check — the
terminal never counts as focused, so Unfocused behaves like Always.

## Uninstall

Run from the clone — the script removes what it installed relative to its own
location, so keep the checkout around if you want this:

```bash
./install.sh --uninstall
```

That deletes `zellaude.wasm` and `zellaude-hook.sh`, drops zellaude's block from
`permissions.kdl`, and strips the hook entries from `~/.claude/settings.json`
and `~/.codex/hooks.json` (backing both up again first). Restart Zellij
afterwards.

Three things it does not touch:

- **Your Zellij layout** — put `zellij:tab-bar` back by hand.
- **`~/.config/zellij/plugins/zellaude.json`** — your settings, custom states
  and session templates.
- **Generated session layouts** in `~/.config/zellij/layouts/`. Every layout
  zellaude compiled is still there, and each one still points at the
  now-deleted `zellaude.wasm`, so `zellij -n zellaude` after an uninstall opens
  a session with a broken plugin pane in every tab. They are the files whose
  first line is exactly `// zellaude-generated <version> <name>` with
  `<name>` matching the filename (minus `.kdl`) — the same test the plugin
  itself uses, so this lists exactly the files it owns; list them, then
  delete the ones you no longer want:

  ```bash
  awk 'FNR==1 && NF==4 && $0 ~ /^\/\/ zellaude-generated / {n=FILENAME; sub(/^.*\//,"",n); sub(/\.kdl$/,"",n); if ($4==n) print FILENAME}' ~/.config/zellij/layouts/*.kdl
  ```

## How it works

Three components:

1. **WASM plugin** — runs inside Zellij, receives events, maintains state in memory, renders the status bar, and sends desktop notifications. On first load, it writes the hook script to `~/.config/zellij/plugins/zellaude-hook.sh` and registers it in `~/.claude/settings.json` and `~/.codex/hooks.json`.
2. **Hook script** — a thin bash bridge that forwards Claude Code and Codex hook events to the plugin via `zellij pipe`
3. **Attach probe** — runs once when the plugin attaches, maps live agent processes to their real Zellij pane IDs, and restores their current effort modes without waiting for another prompt

```
Claude Code / Codex hook → zellaude-hook.sh → zellij pipe → plugin → render
```

The hook script and registration are version-tagged and updated automatically when the plugin version changes.
The registered hook command uses `${HOME}/.config/zellij/plugins/zellaude-hook.sh`; Claude Code expands `${HOME}` when it runs hooks, keeping the settings entry portable across machines.

Codex currently records its active reasoning effort in the hook transcript rather than hook input, while Claude Code reports `ultracode` as ordinary `xhigh` effort. Zellaude resolves both best-effort from the live session transcript and launch flags. Custom Claude launchers that hide `--effort ultracode` can export `ZELLAUDE_CLAUDE_MODE=ultracode` when Claude's active effort remains `xhigh`.

The hook also keeps the last root-session state in a private per-user cache so a
new plugin instance can restore it. On Linux, attach recovery additionally uses
Zellij's pane PID and procfs to identify an already-running root session exactly;
ambiguous matches are ignored. Multiple plugin instances (one per tab) sync
state automatically via inter-plugin messaging. Cache entries are removed on a
normal session end, and sessions are cleaned up automatically when tabs close.
